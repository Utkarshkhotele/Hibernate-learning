# Hibernate Learning ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of **Hibernate ORM** with **MySQL** using Java.  
The goal is to understand how Hibernate works, from basic configuration to entity relationships and CRUD operations.

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned So Far


### âœ… Day 1: Hibernate Basics
- Added Hibernate & MySQL dependencies in `pom.xml`
- Configured `hibernate.cfg.xml`
- Tested Hibernate connection to MySQL database
- Learned that Hibernate auto-creates tables from Java classes (`@Entity`)

### âœ… Day 2: Mapping & Relationships
- Learned mapping annotations:  
  - `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@Column`
- Practiced basic CRUD: Insert, Fetch, Update, Delete
- Understood real-world need for **Relationships**:  
  - One-to-One  
  - One-to-Many

## âš  Warnings Observed
- Built-in connection pool (not for production)
- MySQLDialect warning (auto-selected)
- No JTA platform available
- Auto-commit during schema update

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Java 17+ (JDK 24 in my case)  
- Hibernate ORM 6.x  
- MySQL 8.x  
- Maven  
- IntelliJ IDEA  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
- Explore One-to-One and One-to-Many relationships in Hibernate
- Implement real-world mapping examples (Userâ€“Profile, Studentâ€“Courses)
